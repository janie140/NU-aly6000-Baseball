MVP Recommendation: Batting statistics from the 1986 Major League Baseball season
I have never ever watched a full baseball match then I almost have no clue about this sport. However, the data set of Batting statistics from the 1986 Major League Baseball season has helped open my eyes and brought me some aspects of appealing information about MLB. I am given insights based on the data statistics and analysis only. Therefore, my MVP recommendation might remain a limited notion.
According to BBWAA (Baseball Writer Association of America), there are 10 spots on the ballot for MVP. The rules of the voting remain the same as they were written on the first ballot in 1931, indicating some crucial points such as “Actual value of a player to his team, that is, the strength of offense and defense”, “Number of games played”, “General character, disposition, loyalty and effort” and so on. With the batting statistics processed through R analysis, I present some key findings of batting, namely BA (Batting Average), OBP (On-Base Percentage), HR (Home Runs Hit), RBI (Runs Battle In), whereas OBP is a better stat than batting average. So, I only focus on OBP, HR, and RBI for this recommendation. As seen in the below scatterplot figure, HR and RBI elements are positively correlative.

RBI elements are positively correlative.

Going further on the data set, I created more indexes on the Rank HR, Rank RBI and Rank OBP of eligible players data table, in which a player must have either at least 300 at-bats (AB) or appear in at least 100 games (G). Finally, a Total Rank criteria - a sum of three rank indexes will determine the ranking of 20 potential MVPs. After sorting the lowest values of the Total Rank column, it returns Don Mattingly and Mike Schmidt in the 1st and 2nd places respectively with the same Total Rank. I would recommend Don Mattingly as the MVP because of his comprehensive overall ranking values.
